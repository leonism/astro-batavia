# Computer Vision Applications: How Machines See and Understand the World

Computer vision enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world, revolutionizing industries through automated visual analysis and intelligent decision-making.

## Autonomous Vehicles

Self-driving cars rely on computer vision to detect obstacles, read traffic signs, identify pedestrians, and navigate safely through complex environments.

## Medical Imaging

AI-powered diagnostic systems analyze X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans to detect diseases, assist radiologists, and improve patient outcomes through early detection.

## Retail and E-commerce

Visual search, product recognition, and automated checkout systems enhance shopping experiences while optimizing inventory management.

## Security and Surveillance

Facial recognition, anomaly detection, and behavioral analysis improve security systems for airports, buildings, and public spaces.

## Manufacturing Quality Control

Automated visual inspection systems detect defects, ensure quality standards, and optimize production processes in real-time.

Computer vision continues advancing rapidly, enabling new applications and improving accuracy across diverse use cases.
