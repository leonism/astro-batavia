        <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>

        <p>
          Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer,
          tablet, or mobile) when you visit a website. They are widely used to
          make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information
          to the owners of the site.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>

        <p>We use cookies for various purposes, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Website Functionality:</strong> To enable core features and ensure
            the website operates correctly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics:</strong> To understand how visitors interact with
            our website, which helps us improve its design and content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Personalization:</strong> To remember your preferences and provide
            a more personalized browsing experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advertising:</strong> To deliver relevant advertisements to you
            based on your interests.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>

        <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            These cookies are strictly necessary for the website to function and
            cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in
            response to actions made by you which amount to a request for
            services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or
            filling in forms.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Performance and Analytics Cookies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can
            measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to
            know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors
            move around the site. All information these cookies collect is
            aggregated and therefore anonymous.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Functionality Cookies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality
            and personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party
            providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not
            allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not
            function properly.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Targeting/Advertising Cookies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising
            partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of
            your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do
            not store directly personal information but are based on uniquely
            identifying your browser and internet device.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Cookies</h2>

        <p>
          In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-parties
          cookies to report usage statistics of the Service, deliver
          advertisements on and through the Service, and so on.
        </p>

            cookies through their settings. You can set your browser to refuse all
            or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access
            cookies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Opt-out Links:</strong> Some third-party services provide direct
